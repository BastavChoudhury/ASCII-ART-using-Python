# ASCII-ART-using-Python

ASCII, in full American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers. 
ASCII assigns standard numeric values to letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and other characters used in computers.

Using the ASCII_MAGIC Python library, we can create ASCII code for any image format, which leads to many masterpieces of art.
ascii_magic library is one of the most used libraries for ASCII art, including this project.

There are three image files present in Folder Task 1:
1. Hacktoberfes.jpg
2. Pikachu.jpg
3. TechVine.jpg

The python file chooseArt.py lets you choose any of the pictures mentioned above and take user input.
